## Description

Here is a Python program using the pandas and matplotlib libraries to create a line chart showing the trend of dengue cases over time. This example assumes you have a CSV file with two columns: "Date" and "Cases," where "Date" is in a datetime format and "Cases" represents the number of dengue cases reported.

## Technologies-used

Python programming language, pandas and matplotlib package.

## Dataset

The data file used in this program is a csv file which has been generated by another program. However, it is recommended that for real life analysis actual data should be collected and processed properly to get realistic results.

## Program-codes

The programs are written on jupiter notebook, You may run the program on Google colab by clicking on the colab badge below.

**This program is designed to analyze and visualize the trend of dengue cases over time using a plot. Here's what can be inferred from the plot generated by this program:**

- **Trend Over Time:** The plot will show how the number of dengue cases has changed over time. This can help in identifying patterns, such as whether the number of cases is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable.

- **Seasonal Patterns:** By looking at the monthly totals, one can identify if there are any seasonal trends. For instance, are there certain months or seasons when dengue cases are consistently higher?

- **Peaks and Troughs:** The plot can highlight specific periods when the number of dengue cases peaked or dropped significantly. This can be useful for understanding the timing of outbreaks.

- **Effectiveness of Interventions:** If there were known interventions or public health measures taken at specific times, the plot can help assess their impact. For example, a sudden drop in cases following an intervention might suggest its effectiveness.

- **Long-Term Trends:** Over a more extended period, the plot can indicate whether dengue is becoming more or less of a problem in the area.

- **Comparison Across Periods:** If the data spans multiple years, the plot allows for a comparison of dengue cases year over year to see if certain years were particularly bad or if the situation is improving over time.
